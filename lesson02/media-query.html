            <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 43:18</h2>
            <p>For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven; the heavens shall shake and the
                earth shall tremble, and the trump of God shall sound both long and loud, and shall say to the sleeping
                nations: Ye saints arise and live; ye sinners stay and sleep until I shall call again.</p>

            <h2>Alma 38:2</h2>
            <p>And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your
                faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so
                I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.
